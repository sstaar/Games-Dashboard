    Please note that this project has not been tested for building and is not ready for production.

## Data
    Currently, the data is not persistent, meaning that it will be reset to the initial data whenever the website is refreshed. However, the plan is to implement a simple API to store the mock data and make it persistent. I am working on this feature, and it will be available soon. Once implemented, the data will be persistent.

## Authentication
    Multiple usernames and passwords can be used for login, which are located in /src/mockapi/data/users.json. Here are a few examples:

        -Username: channanrr, Password: UTnl3p
        -Username: rabramirp, Password: HVRipS4v
        -Username: sworttrq, Password: clcSvMAWHkf
